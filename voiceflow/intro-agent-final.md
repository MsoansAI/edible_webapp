# Introductory Agent - Final Implementation (Using Existing Context)

This is the correct implementation that uses the context variables already passed from the webapp to Voiceflow.

## 🎯 Available Context Variables (Already Passed from Webapp)

The intro agent has access to these variables in every conversation turn:

```javascript
// Authentication context
isAuthenticated: {isAuthenticated}  // boolean
userId: {userId}                    // string or null
userName: {userName}                // string or null
userEmail: {userEmail}              // string or null
userRole: {userRole}                // 'guest' | 'authenticated'

// Cart context
cartItemCount: {cartItemCount}      // number
cartTotal: {cartTotal}              // number
cartData: {cartData}                // full cart object with items, summary, itemDetails

// User preferences
lastOrderDate: {lastOrderDate}      // string or null
preferredDeliveryZip: {preferredDeliveryZip} // string or null

// Session metadata
sessionTimestamp: {sessionTimestamp} // ISO string
source: {source}                     // 'website'
```

## 🚀 Smart Routing Logic (No API Calls Needed!)

### **Step 1: Assess Customer State**

```javascript
// All information is already available as variables!
const customer_authenticated = isAuthenticated;
const customer_name = userName || "there";
const has_cart_items = cartItemCount > 0;
const cart_value = cartTotal;
const cart_details = cartData;

// Determine customer type
let customer_type = "";
if (customer_authenticated) {
  customer_type = "authenticated";
} else if (has_cart_items) {
  customer_type = "anonymous_with_cart";
} else {
  customer_type = "anonymous_new";
}
```

### **Step 2: Generate Dynamic Greeting**

```javascript
let greeting = "";

if (customer_type === "authenticated") {
  if (has_cart_items) {
    greeting = `Welcome back, ${customer_name}! I notice you have ${cartItemCount} item${cartItemCount > 1 ? 's' : ''} in your cart worth $${cartTotal}. Would you like some help completing your order, or is there something else I can assist you with today?`;
  } else if (lastOrderDate) {
    greeting = `Hello ${customer_name}! Welcome back! What can I help you with today?`;
  } else {
    greeting = `Welcome back, ${customer_name}! Great to see you again. What can I help you with today?`;
  }
} else {
  // Anonymous user
  if (has_cart_items) {
    greeting = `Hi there! Welcome to Edible Arrangements! I notice you have ${cartItemCount} item${cartItemCount > 1 ? 's' : ''} in your cart worth $${cartTotal}. Would you like some help completing your order, or is there something else I can assist you with today?`;
  } else {
    greeting = "Hi there! Welcome to Edible Arrangements! I'm here to help you with whatever you need today. Are you looking to place an order, or do you have questions about our products?";
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Routing Decision**

```javascript
let routing_decision = "";
let handoff_message = "";

const last_message_lower = last_message.toLowerCase();

// Check for explicit order management intent
if (last_message_lower.includes("order") && 
    (last_message_lower.includes("track") || 
     last_message_lower.includes("modify") ||
     last_message_lower.includes("cancel") ||
     last_message_lower.includes("status"))) {
  routing_decision = "order-management";
  handoff_message = "I understand you need help with your existing order. Let me connect you with our order management team.";
}
// Check for ordering intent (has cart or wants to order)
else if (has_cart_items || 
         last_message_lower.includes("order") ||
         last_message_lower.includes("birthday") ||
         last_message_lower.includes("anniversary") ||
         last_message_lower.includes("buy") ||
         last_message_lower.includes("purchase")) {
  routing_decision = "ordering";
  handoff_message = has_cart_items 
    ? "Perfect! Let me connect you with our ordering specialist who can help you complete your purchase."
    : "Great! Let me connect you with our ordering specialist who can help you find the perfect arrangement.";
}
// Stay with intro agent for general questions
else {
  routing_decision = "intro-support";
  handoff_message = "I'd be happy to help you with that!";
}
```

### **Step 4: Prepare Context for Handoff**

```javascript
// Create context package using existing variables
const context_package = {
  customer: {
    isAuthenticated: isAuthenticated,
    name: userName || "there",
    email: userEmail,
    userId: userId,
    role: userRole
  },
  cart: {
    hasItems: cartItemCount > 0,
    itemCount: cartItemCount,
    total: cartTotal,
    data: cartData
  },
  session: {
    timestamp: sessionTimestamp,
    source: source,
    lastOrderDate: lastOrderDate,
    preferredZip: preferredDeliveryZip
  },
  routing: {
    reason: has_cart_items ? "customer has items in cart" : "customer expressed intent",
    decision: routing_decision
  }
};
```

## 🛠️ Voiceflow Implementation

### **No API Steps Needed!**

Instead of API steps, use **Code Steps** to process existing variables:

#### **Code Step 1: Customer Assessment**
```javascript
// Process existing context variables
const customer_authenticated = isAuthenticated;
const customer_name = userName || "there";
const has_cart_items = cartItemCount > 0;
const cart_value = cartTotal || 0;

// Set derived variables
if (customer_authenticated) {
  customer_type = "authenticated";
} else if (has_cart_items) {
  customer_type = "anonymous_with_cart";
} else {
  customer_type = "anonymous_new";
}
```

#### **Code Step 2: Generate Greeting**
```javascript
let greeting = "";

if (customer_type === "authenticated") {
  if (has_cart_items) {
    greeting = `Welcome back, ${customer_name}! I notice you have ${cartItemCount} item${cartItemCount > 1 ? 's' : ''} in your cart worth $${cartTotal}. Would you like some help completing your order, or is there something else I can assist you with today?`;
  } else {
    greeting = `Welcome back, ${customer_name}! Great to see you again. What can I help you with today?`;
  }
} else {
  if (has_cart_items) {
    greeting = `Hi there! Welcome to Edible Arrangements! I notice you have ${cartItemCount} item${cartItemCount > 1 ? 's' : ''} in your cart worth $${cartTotal}. Would you like some help completing your order, or is there something else I can assist you with today?`;
  } else {
    greeting = "Hi there! Welcome to Edible Arrangements! I'm here to help you with whatever you need today. Are you looking to place an order, or do you have questions about our products?";
  }
}
```

#### **Code Step 3: Routing Logic**
```javascript
const last_message_lower = last_message.toLowerCase();

if (last_message_lower.includes("order") && 
    (last_message_lower.includes("track") || 
     last_message_lower.includes("modify") ||
     last_message_lower.includes("status"))) {
  routing_decision = "order-management";
  handoff_message = "I understand you need help with your existing order. Let me connect you with our order management team.";
} else if (has_cart_items || 
           last_message_lower.includes("order") ||
           last_message_lower.includes("birthday") ||
           last_message_lower.includes("buy")) {
  routing_decision = "ordering";
  handoff_message = has_cart_items 
    ? "Perfect! Let me connect you with our ordering specialist who can help you complete your purchase."
    : "Great! Let me connect you with our ordering specialist who can help you find the perfect arrangement.";
} else {
  routing_decision = "intro-support";
  handoff_message = "I'd be happy to help you with that!";
}
```

### **Conditional Paths Based on Routing**

#### **Path 1: Route to Ordering Agent**
- **Condition**: `routing_decision === "ordering"`
- **Action**: Go to Ordering Agent Flow
- **Variables to Pass**:
  ```json
  {
    "handoff_context": "{{context_package}}",
    "customer_intent": "ordering",
    "has_cart_items": "{{has_cart_items}}",
    "customer_name": "{{customer_name}}",
    "cart_data": "{{cartData}}"
  }
  ```

#### **Path 2: Route to Order Management Agent**
- **Condition**: `routing_decision === "order-management"`
- **Action**: Go to Order Management Flow
- **Variables to Pass**:
  ```json
  {
    "customer_intent": "order_management",
    "customer_name": "{{customer_name}}",
    "customer_id": "{{userId}}",
    "is_authenticated": "{{isAuthenticated}}"
  }
  ```

#### **Path 3: Stay with Intro Agent**
- **Condition**: `routing_decision === "intro-support"`
- **Action**: Continue in current flow

## ✅ Performance Benefits

1. **⚡ Zero API Calls**: Uses existing context variables
2. **🚀 Instant Response**: No waiting for database queries
3. **💰 No Costs**: No edge function calls
4. **🎯 Real-time Data**: Cart and auth state always current
5. **🧹 Clean Architecture**: Uses existing infrastructure

## 📊 Customer Experience Examples

### **Authenticated User with Cart**:
```
"Welcome back, Sarah! I notice you have 2 items in your cart worth $89.98. Would you like some help completing your order, or is there something else I can assist you with today?"
```

### **Anonymous User with Cart**:
```
"Hi there! Welcome to Edible Arrangements! I notice you have 1 item in your cart worth $49.99. Would you like some help completing your order, or is there something else I can assist you with today?"
```

### **Authenticated User, No Cart**:
```
"Welcome back, John! Great to see you again. What can I help you with today?"
```

### **Anonymous User, No Cart**:
```
"Hi there! Welcome to Edible Arrangements! I'm here to help you with whatever you need today. Are you looking to place an order, or do you have questions about our products?"
```

## 🔄 Integration with Your Existing Ordering Agent

The intro agent can seamlessly pass context to your existing ordering agent using the variables that are already available:

```json
{
  "order_details": {
    "order_card": "{{context_package}}"
  },
  "isAuthenticated": "{{isAuthenticated}}",
  "customerAllergies": "{{allergies}}",
  "store_id": "{{selected_store_id}}",
  "customer_context": "{{customer_name}} - {{routing_reason}}",
  "cartData": "{{cartData}}"
}
```

**This approach is perfect - it uses the existing, real-time context without any unnecessary API calls!**
