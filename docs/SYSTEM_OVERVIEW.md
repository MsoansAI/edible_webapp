# System Overview

## 1. Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, AI-driven assistant for Edible Arrangements. This system serves as a sophisticated interface between customers, individual franchise stores, and the corporate headquarters. The goal is to streamline the entire online ordering and customer support process, particularly during high-volume seasonal peaks (e.g., Valentine's Day, Mother's Day), to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce operational delays, and minimize refund requests.

## 2. Core Components

The system is composed of several interconnected components that work in concert to provide a seamless user experience:

-   **Frontend Web Application:** A Next.js-based web application that serves as the primary customer-facing interface. It integrates a dynamic chatbot and traditional e-commerce functionalities.
-   **AI Chat & Voice Agent:** A sophisticated chatbot, powered by Voiceflow and OpenAI, integrated into the web app. It is capable of taking orders, providing product recommendations, and handling basic customer support queries through both text and voice.
-   **Supabase Backend:** The entire backend is built on Supabase, which provides:
    -   **PostgreSQL Database:** The central source of truth for all data, including products, customers, franchisees, and orders.
    -   **Edge Functions:** A suite of Deno-based, serverless functions that handle the core business logic, such as product searches, customer management, inventory checks, and order processing.
    -   **Authentication:** Manages user and customer authentication.
-   **External Service Integrations:** The system leverages several third-party services for specialized functionality:
    -   **OpenAI:** Provides the natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI capabilities for the chatbot.
    -   **Voiceflow:** Manages the conversational logic and state for the AI agent.
    -   **VAPI:** Handles the real-time voice and telephony integration.
    -   **Stripe:** (Planned) for processing payments.

## 3. User & Data Flow

The typical user journey and data flow are as follows:

1.  **Interaction:** A customer visits the Edible Arrangements website and initiates a conversation with the AI agent via chat or voice.
2.  **Authentication/Identification:** The `customer-management` edge function identifies the user by phone or email, creating a new profile or retrieving an existing one. For logged-in users, the `user-profile` function retrieves their data.
3.  **Product Discovery:** The customer describes what they're looking for. The frontend sends this query to the `product-search` edge function, which uses vector embeddings (generated by the `generate-embedding` function) to find the most relevant products.
4.  **Store & Inventory Check:** The customer provides their location (e.g., ZIP code). The `franchisee-inventory` function finds the nearest store and checks product availability.
5.  **Cart Management:** As the customer adds items, the `cart-manager` function manages the state of their shopping cart.
6.  **Order Placement & Modification:**
    -   The `order` function is called to create a new order, generating a unique order number and calculating totals.
    -   The `order-items` function is used to add, update, or remove items from an existing order, with built-in logic to handle complex scenarios like partial removals and order cancellations.
    -   **⭐ NEW: Payment Link Generation** - The `order` function can generate secure payment links (PUT endpoint) for customers to pay online after phone order confirmation.
7.  **Database Update:** All actions are transactionally recorded in the Supabase PostgreSQL database. Triggers and functions within the database work to denormalize data into "flat" tables (e.g., `chatbot_orders_flat`) for efficient retrieval by the AI agent.
8.  **Confirmation & Payment:** The customer receives a confirmation of their order. For phone orders, they can receive a secure payment link to complete payment online. The relevant franchisee is notified upon payment completion.

This architecture creates a robust, scalable, and intelligent system designed to automate and enhance the entire customer lifecycle.
