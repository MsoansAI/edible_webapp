## Data Transformations Applied

### 1. Handle to Product Identifier Conversion
- Extracted numeric IDs from `product-code-XXXX` format
- Mapped to 4-digit product identifiers (3075-9469)
- Ensured compatibility with existing schema constraints

### 2. Product Grouping and Base Price Calculation
- Grouped CSV rows by handle to create single products
- Calculated base price as minimum variant price
- Used first non-empty title and description per product group

### 3. Product Options Creation
- Created separate product_options records for each variant
- Mapped option names from CSV option1_value field
- Generated descriptive text based on option patterns:
  - "Janes Garden" → "Beautiful Janes Garden style arrangement"
  - "Modern Mosaic" → "Contemporary Modern Mosaic design"
  - "MOM"/"MAMA" → "Special arrangement featuring [MOM/MAMA]"
  - Berry types → Specific berry descriptions

### 4. Category Associations
- All products associated with "Mother's Day" occasion category
- Automatic category slug matching ensured
- Spring season category also available for seasonal filtering

### 5. Ingredient Mapping
- Intelligent ingredient detection based on product names:

  - Balloon products → balloons ingredient
  - Fruit arrangements → pineapple ingredient

### 6. Inventory Setup
- Created inventory records for all products
- Set initial quantity: 150 units per product
- Associated with existing franchisee (Boston Downtown)

### Sample Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check product with multiple options
SELECT p.name, po.option_name, po.price 
FROM products p 
JOIN product_options po ON p.id = po.product_id 
WHERE p.product_identifier = 6444;

-- Verify category associations
SELECT p.name, c.name as category 
FROM products p 
JOIN product_categories pc ON p.id = pc.product_id 
JOIN categories c ON pc.category_id = c.id 
WHERE p.product_identifier = 3075;

-- Check chatbot flat table
SELECT product_data->'product_info'->>'name' as name,
       jsonb_array_length(product_data->'options') as options
FROM chatbot_products_flat 
WHERE (product_data->'product_info'->>'product_identifier')::int = 9469;
```

## Import Process Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
```sql
-- Created temporary table with cleaned CSV structure
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_csv_products (
    handle TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    included_in_store BOOLEAN,
    image_src TEXT,
    option1_value TEXT,
    variant_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    available_quantity INTEGER
);
```

### 2. Product Creation
```sql
-- Grouped by handle and created products with base prices
WITH product_groups AS (
  SELECT handle, 
         MIN(variant_price) as base_price,
         MAX(title) as product_title
  FROM temp_csv_products 
  GROUP BY handle
)
INSERT INTO products (product_identifier, name, base_price, ...)
```

### 3. Options Mapping
```sql
-- Created product options for each variant
INSERT INTO product_options (product_id, option_name, price, description)
SELECT ip.id, tcp.option1_value, tcp.variant_price, 
       CASE WHEN tcp.option1_value LIKE '%Garden%' THEN '...' END
```

### 4. Associations
```sql
-- Added category and ingredient associations
INSERT INTO product_categories (product_id, category_id)
INSERT INTO product_ingredients (product_id, ingredient_id)
```
